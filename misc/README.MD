## Pay by seconds for your GPU

For people who are interested in those big modules(such as BERT, GPT, etc.), there is no better choices than utilising a cloud GPU from GCP or AWS for your research work. With just a couple of command lines, one can create a powerful Machine Learning computer to test one's idea out, without too much concern about the computation. However after numerous times making use of a cloud GPU, whether you are a student in a university or a recent AI graduate student, you often face bills from either Google or Amazon or Micrisoft for your unawareness of excessive use of the cloud resource.    

I've been in such situations multiple times, and many times I have to pay with my own money, because I did use those resource with my own account(Thanks to my current employer I get to use the cloud resources with my employer's support). Yet I still am thinking of ways to minimize the the cose of my use of cloud resources. 

cloudrun.sh is a handy tool that can help me use cloud resource effectively, especially when I am in need of several cutting edge GPUs to test my ideas.
