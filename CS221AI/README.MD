### Reflex based models  
1. Machine Learning    

### State based models: 
2. Search problems (Agent control everything)  
3. Markov decision processes (Agent against nature)  
4. Adversarial games (Agent against opponent, such as another agent)  

#### Applications  
* Games: Chess, Go, Pac-Man, Black-Jack, StarCraft, etc  
* Robotics: motion planning  
* Natural Language Processing: Machine Translation, Image Captioning  

### Variables: 
5. Constraint Satisfaction Problems  
6. Bayesian Networks  

#### Applications  
* CSP application: Sudoku, put digits in blank squares so each row, column and 3x3 sub-block has digits 1-9  
* Bayesian Networks: Tracking cars from sensors  
* State based models vs Variable based models: the order in which things are done isn't important.
