    "## 6.1 Introduction\n",
    "Statistical inference or \"learning\" as it is called in CS, is the process of using data to infer the distribution that generated the data.\n",

    "## 6.2 Parametric and Nonparametric Models\n",
    "A statistical model $\\mathfrak{F}$ is a set of distributions/densities/regression functions. A parametric model is a set $\\mathfrak{F}$ that can be parameterized by a finite number of parameters. For example, if we assume that the data is from a Normal distribution, it's model is:  \n",
    "$\\mathfrak{F}=\\{f(x;\\mu,\\delta)-\\frac{1}{\\delta \\sqrt{2\\pi}}exp\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\delta^2}(x-\\mu)^2 \\}, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\delta > 0 \\} \\tag{6.1}$  \n",
    "In general a parametric model takes the form:  \n",
    "$\\mathfrak{F}=\\{f(x;\\mu,\\theta): \\theta \\in \\Theta \\}$ where $\\Theta$ is the parameter space.  \n",
    "If $\\theta$ is a vector and we only interested in one compoment of it, the remaining part is called 'nuisance parameters'.  \n",
    "A nonparametric model is a set $\\mathfrak{F}$ that cannot be parameterized by a finite number of parameters. For example $\\mathfrak{F}_{ALL}={all CDF} $ is nonparametric.   \n",
    "\n",
    "E6.1 (One-dimensional Parametric Estimation). Let iid $X_i$~Bernoulli(p), the problem is to estimate the parameter p.\n",
    "\n",
    "E6.2 (Two-dimensional Parametric Estimation). Let iid $X_i$~F and we assume that the PDF $f \\in \\mathfrak{F}$ given in (6.1). There are two parameters $\\mu,\\delta$, the goal is to estimate the two parameters from the data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "E6.3 (Nonparametric estimation of the CDF). Let iid $X_i$ be independent observations from CDF F. The problem is to estimate F assuming only that $F \\in \\mathfrak{F}$. In chapter 7 the empirical distribution function $\\hat{F}$ is one example.    \n",
    "\n",
    "E6.4 (Nonparametric density estimation). Let $X_i$ be iid from CDF F and leet f=F' be the PDF. Suppose we want to estimate PDF. It is not possible to estimate f assuming only that $F\\in \\mathfrak{F}$. We need to assume some smoothness on f. For example we might assume that $f \\in \\mathfrak{F} =\\mathfrak{F}_{DENS} \\cap \\mathfrak{F}_{SOB}$ where $\\mathfrak{F}_{DENS}$ is the set of all probability density functions and $\\mathfrak{F}_{SOB}=\\{ f:\\int(f''(x))^2dx < \\infty \\}$. The class $\\mathfrak{F}_{SOB}$ is called a Sobolev space; it is the set of functions that are not too 'wiggly'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "E6.5 (Nonparametric estimation of functionals). Let iid $X_i$ ~ F. A Statistical Functional is a function of F, denoted as T(F). For example the mean $\\mu=T(F)=\\int x dF(x)$ is a statistical functional. Other examples include variance, skewness, coorelation, etc.    \n",
    "\n",
    "E6.6 (Regression, prediction and classification). Suppose we observe pairs of data ($X_i, Y_i$). Perhaps $X_i$ is the blood pressure of subject i and $Y_i$ is how long they live.  \n",
    "X: predictor, regressor, feature, independent variable;  \n",
    "Y: outcome, response, dependent variable.  \n",
    "$r(x)=\\mathbb{E}(Y|X=x)$ is called regression function. Think about linear regression. The cost function of LR is $J(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^m (h_{\\theta}(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$ and the task is to estimate $h_{\\theta}$ given the data. But how is it associated with the 'regression function' we mentioned here? If we interpret LR in probabilistic way, and assume the response variable satisfies: $Y|X \\sim N(\\theta^T X, \\delta^2)$ where $\\delta$ is some variance, then the regression function is just $r(x)=\\mathbb{E}(Y|X=x)$ based on the distribution, and in LR case it is just the mean of Normal: $r(x) = h_{\\theta} = \\theta^T x$.   \n",
    "If $r\\in\\mathfrak{F}$ where $\\mathfrak{F}$ is finite dimensional, the set of straight lines for example, then we have a parametric regression model. If $\\mathfrak{F}$ is not finite dimensional then we have a nonparametric regression model. The goal of predicting Y for a given X is called Prediction. If Y is discrete then the prediction is called classification. The goal of estimation the function r is called regression or curve estimation.    \n",
    "The regression model is also written as $Y=r(X)+\\epsilon$ where $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)=0$.   \n",
    "PROOF: $\\mathbb{E}(Y)=\\mathbb{E}(r(X)+\\epsilon)=\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}(Y|X)]+\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)=\\mathbb{E}(Y)+\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)$ which gives $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)=0$   \n",

    "## 6.3 Fundamental Concepts in Inference  \n",
    "Point estimation refers to providing a single \"best guess\" of some quantity of interest. The quantity of interest could be a parameter in a parametric model, a CDF F, a probability density function f, a regression function r, or a prediction for a future value Y of some random variable.  \n",
    "A point estimation of $\\theta$ is denoted by $\\hat{\\theta}$ or $\\hat{\\theta_n}$. $\\theta$ is a fixed unknown quantity in the universe, it is also called the 'true value'.    \n",
    "More generally a point estimator $\\hat\\theta_n$ of a parameter $\\theta$ is some function of $X_i$: $\\hat\\theta_n=g(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$. Since the iid data points are random variables, its dependent $\\hat\\theta_n$ is also a r.v. and we can find out its distribution based on X.  \n",
    "The bias of an estimator is defined as: $bias(\\hat{\\theta_n})=\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\theta_n})-\\theta$. If $\\mathbb{E}(\\hat{\\theta_n})=\\theta$ we say that the estimation is unbiased. Although many of the estimators in use are biased, a reasonable requirement is it should converge to the true value as we collect more and more data.   \n",
    "D6.7 A point estimator $\\hat\\theta_n$ of a parameter $\\theta$ is consistent if $\\hat\\theta_n \\overset{p}{\\longrightarrow} \\theta$  \n",
    "Again since $\\hat\\theta_n$ is a r.v. and has its own distribution, its distribution is called sampling distribution. The standard deviation of $\\hat\\theta_n$ is called standard error denoted by: $$se=se(\\hat\\theta_n)=\\sqrt{\\mathbb{V}(\\hat\\theta_n)}$$.  \n",
    "Often, the standard error depends on the unknown F. In those cases, se is an unknown quantity but we usually can estimate it. The estimated se is denoted by $\\hat{se}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "E6.8 Let iid X~Bernoulli(p) and let $\\hat p_n = \\sum X_i /n$. Then $\\mathbb{E}(\\hat p_n) = n^{-1} \\sum \\mathbb{E}(X_i) = p$ so $\\hat p_n$ is unbiased; The standard error $se=\\sqrt{\\mathbb{V}(\\hat p_n)}=\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$, the estimated standard error is $\\hat{se}=\\sqrt{\\hat p_n (1 - \\hat p_n)/n}$    \n",
    "The quality of a point estimation is sometimes assessed by MSE: Mean Squre Error: $MSE=\\mathbb{E}_\\theta (\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta)^2$   \n",
    "T6.9 The MSE can be written as $MSE=bias^2(\\hat\\theta_n)+\\mathbb{V}(\\hat\\theta_n)$  \n",
    "PROOF: $bias^2+\\mathbb{V} \\\\ = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta^2(\\hat\\theta_n) - 2\\theta \\mathbb{E}_\\theta(\\hat\\theta_n) + \\theta^2 + \\mathbb{E}_\\theta(\\hat\\theta_n^2)-\\mathbb{E}_\\theta^2(\\hat\\theta_n) \\\\ = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta(\\hat\\theta_n^2) - 2\\theta \\mathbb{E}_\\theta(\\hat\\theta_n) + \\theta^2 \\\\ = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta^2(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta)$   \n",
    "\n",
    "T6.10 If $bias \\longrightarrow 0$ and $se \\longrightarrow 0$ as $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ then $\\hat\\theta_n$ is consistent, that is, $\\hat\\theta_n \\overset{p}{\\longrightarrow} \\theta $.   \n"
